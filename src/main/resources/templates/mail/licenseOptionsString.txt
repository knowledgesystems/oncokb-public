To move forward, could you share a little more information â€“ in particular, we would like to understand the specific context of your OncoKB use-case, and how you envision implementing it into your workflow.

As far as licensing terms, MSK offers the following options
- a flat fee for research in commercial companies
- charge per report on a tiered fee schedule depending on the volume of reports generated, with a set minimum annual royalty
- hybrid of both

Toward that, does your company have a budget in mind for an OncoKB License? If applicable, perhaps a conference call can be arranged as a next step.

Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to hearing from you.
