<p th:text="'Dear ' + ${user.firstName} + ' ' + ${user.lastName} + ','"></p>

<p th:text="'Thank you for your interest in the ' + ${license} + ' license for OncoKB.'"></p>

<p>
  To move forward, could you share a little more information â€“ in particular, we would like to understand the specific context of your OncoKB use-case, and how you envision implementing it into your workflow.
</p>
<p>
  As far as licensing terms, MSK offers the following options
  - a flat fee for research in commercial companies
  - charge per report on a tiered fee schedule depending on the volume of reports generated, with a set minimum annual royalty
  - hybrid of both
</p>
<p>
  Toward that, does <span th:text="${user.companyName}"></span> have a budget in mind for an OncoKB License? If applicable, perhaps a conference call can be arranged as a next step.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to hearing from you.
</p>
