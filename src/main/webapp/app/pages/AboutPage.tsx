            OncoKB is a precision oncology knowledge base and contains

            Curated by a network of clinical fellows, research fellows, and
            faculty members at MSK, OncoKB contains detailed information about
            specific alterations in {props.appStore.mainNumbers.result.gene}{' '}
            cancer genes. The information is curated from various sources, such
            as guidelines from the FDA, NCCN, or ASCO,{' '}

            and the scientific literature.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each alteration, we have curated the biological effect,
            prevalence and prognostic information, as well as treatment
            implications. Treatment information is classified using the{' '}
            <Link to="/levels">Levels of Evidence</Link> system which assigns
            the clinical actionability (ranging from standard-of-care to
            investigational or hypothetical treatments) to individual mutational
            events. OncoKB currently contains treatment information for Level 1
            and Level 2 (those alterations which are FDA-recognized or
            considered standard care biomarkers predictive of response to
            FDA-approved drugs in specific disease settings), Level 3
            alterations (those alterations which are considered predictive of
            response based on promising clinical data to targeted agents being
            tested in clinical trials) and Level 4 (those alterations which are
            considered predictive of response based on compelling biological
            evidence to targeted agents being tested in clinical trials).
