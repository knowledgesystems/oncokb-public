    "description": "Truncating APC mutations result in loss of full-length APC protein leading to impaired or abnormal APC function. APC deregulation is associated with accumulation of β-catenin, an oncogenic transcription factor, which in turn leads to aberrant target gene expression and tumorigenesis (PMID: 11062151). APC truncating mutations are typically early events occurring on a single allele (germline or somatic); however, the tumor often acquires a second hit on the second allele, reducing the overall amount of functional APC in the cell (PMID: 11257105). Furthermore, expression of truncating mutations of APC has been shown to result in chromosomal instability in a dominant manner, postulated to play an important role in the accumulation of additional oncogenic alterations (PMID: 15561772).",

  "background": "APC is a negative regulator of the pro-oncogenic WNT/ β-catenin signaling pathway (PMID: 8259518, 8259519). The main tumor suppressive role of APC is to modulate intracellular levels of β-catenin (PMID: 11978510). APC is an essential member of the destruction complex, which targets cytosolic β-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation (PMID: 10984057). When the activity of APC is lost, there is an aberrant increase in WNT-pathway activation, often leading to hyperplasia and eventually tumor progression (PMID: 8259511). A threshold of APC expression is required to suppress tumor formation, and this level is finely balanced (PMID: 11743581). Germline mutations in the APC gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) (PMID: 1651174, 1651562), a disease in which 95% of people progress to develop colorectal cancer (PMID: 1528264). In addition, heritable mutations in APC are responsible for the development of a number of related diseases, including Turcot Syndrome, Gardner Syndrome and Flat Adenoma Syndrome (FAS) (PMID: 8593545). APC mutations, much like those seen in FAS, have been observed in 50-80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (PMID: 17143297). Somatic mutations in APC function as tumor-initiating events and are also observed in a number of other human cancers including breast, stomach, and prostate (PMID: 27302369, 29316426). The majority of APC mutations are loss-of-function and occur in a region important for β-catenin binding (PMID: 10784639, 1338904). Inhibitors of the WNT pathway are currently in clinical development (PMID: 24981364).",
