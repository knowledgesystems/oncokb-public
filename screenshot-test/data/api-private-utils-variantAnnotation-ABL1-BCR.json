ABL is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and can be activated by growth factor receptors, cellular kinases or DNA damage (PMID: 24421390, 1591775). In response to extrinsic ligand stimulation, ABL signaling regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (PMID: 7651539, 7512450). ABL has additional cellular roles including regulation of actin polymerization, vascular development, transcription, and T cell maturation (PMID: 24421390). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), translocations between the ABL and BCR genes result in the driver fusion protein BCR-ABL (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase that causes ligand-independent activation of signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in loss of auto-inhibition of ABL leading to activation of the kinase (PMID: 8246975). Alternative ABL1 translocations are also observed in myeloid disease (PMID: 9695962). Small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL, imatinib and dasatinib, have been developed and are FDA-approved for CML and Ph+ALL (PMID:11870241, 21931113). Mutations in the ABL kinase domain lead to resistance to these treatments and determine sensitivity to other second-generation inhibitors (PMID: 15256671).","tumorTypes":[{"relevantTumorType":false,"tumorType":{"id":560,"subtype":"Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia","code":"CML","color":"LightSalmon","mainType":"Myeloproliferative Neoplasms","level":4,"tissue":"Myeloid","tumorForm":"LIQUID"},"evidences":[{"id":23,"uuid":"3dd5e15a-9f42-4242-a22e-ab9e8d0807cd","evidenceType":"STANDARD_THERAPEUTIC_IMPLICATIONS_FOR_DRUG_SENSITIVITY","cancerTypes":[{"id":560,"subtype":"Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia","code":"CML","color":"LightSalmon","mainType":"Myeloproliferative Neoplasms","level":4,"tissue":"Myeloid","tumorForm":"LIQUID"}],"relevantCancerTypes":[],"gene":{"entrezGeneId":25,"hugoSymbol":"ABL1","oncogene":true,"grch37Isoform":"ENST00000318560","grch37RefSeq":"NM_005157.4","grch38Isoform":"ENST00000318560","grch38RefSeq":"NM_005157.4","geneAliases":["v-abl","bcr/abl","JTK7","BCR-ABL","c-ABL1","c-ABL","ABL","CHDSKM"],"genesets":[],"tsg":false},"alterations":[{"gene":{"entrezGeneId":25,"hugoSymbol":"ABL1","oncogene":true,"grch37Isoform":"ENST00000318560","grch37RefSeq":"NM_005157.4","grch38Isoform":"ENST00000318560","grch38RefSeq":"NM_005157.4","geneAliases":["v-abl","bcr/abl","JTK7","BCR-ABL","c-ABL1","c-ABL","ABL","CHDSKM"],"genesets":[],"tsg":false},"consequence":{"term":"NA","isGenerallyTruncating":false,"description":"NA"},"alteration":"BCR-ABL1 Fusion","name":"BCR-ABL1 Fusion","refResidues":null,"proteinStart":-1,"proteinEnd":100000,"variantResidues":null,"referenceGenomes":["GRCh38","GRCh37"]}],"description":"","additionalInfo":null,"treatments":[{"approvedIndications":["1) Newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+CML) in chronic phase. 2) Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in blast crisis (BC), accelerated phase (AP), or in chronic phase (CP) after failure of interferon-alpha therapy. 3) Pediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase who are newly diagnosed or whose disease has recurred after stem cell transplant or who are resistant to interferon-alpha therapy."],"priority":1,"drugs":[{"ncitCode":"C62035","drugName":"Imatinib","uuid":"f42768c5-4918-4244-98dd-6ea97a4d3c2a","synonyms":["Imatinib","IMATINIB","4-[(4-Methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]phenyl]benzamide"],"priority":1}]}],"knownEffect":"Sensitive","lastEdit":1547235943000,"lastReview":null,"levelOfEvidence":"LEVEL_1","solidPropagationLevel":"NO","liquidPropagationLevel":"NO","articles":[{"pmid":"12637609","title":"Imatinib compared with interferon and low-dose cytarabine for newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia.","journal":"The New England journal of medicine","pubDate":"2003 Mar 13","volume":"348","issue":"11","pages":"994-1004","authors":"O'Brien SG et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"O'Brien SG et al.
