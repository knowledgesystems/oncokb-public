ABL is located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus and can be activated by growth factor receptors, cellular kinases or DNA damage (PMID: 24421390, 1591775). In response to extrinsic ligand stimulation, ABL signaling regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (PMID: 7651539, 7512450). ABL has additional cellular roles including regulation of actin polymerization, vascular development, transcription, and T cell maturation (PMID: 24421390). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), translocations between the ABL and BCR genes result in the driver fusion protein BCR-ABL (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinase that causes ligand-independent activation of signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 3460176, 2825022). The BCR-ABL fusion protein results in loss of auto-inhibition of ABL leading to activation of the kinase (PMID: 8246975). Alternative ABL1 translocations are also observed in myeloid disease (PMID: 9695962). Small molecule inhibitors of BCR-ABL, imatinib and dasatinib, have been developed and are FDA-approved for CML and Ph+ALL (PMID:11870241, 21931113). Mutations in the ABL kinase domain lead to resistance to these treatments and determine sensitivity to other second-generation inhibitors (PMID: 15256671).","additionalInfo":null,"treatments":[],"knownEffect":null,"lastEdit":1524597678000,"lastReview":null,"levelOfEvidence":null,"solidPropagationLevel":null,"liquidPropagationLevel":null,"articles":[{"pmid":"1591775","title":"c-abl has a sequence-specific enhancer binding activity.","journal":"Cell","pubDate":"1992 May 29","volume":"69","issue":"5","pages":"751-7","authors":"Dikstein R et al","elocationId":"","link":null,"reference":"Dikstein R et al.
