In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70 p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848). However, a trial evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma treated with either combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib compared to those treated with vemurafenib monotherapy demonstrated improved survival outcomes in the combination-therapy group compared to the vemurafenib group (PMID: 25399551)."},{"alterations":["V600K","V600E"],"drugs":[{"ncitCode":"C64768","drugName":"Vemurafenib","uuid":"4e91da20-6cf0-4e07-995f-7f7db4c7c077","synonyms":["Vemurafenib","BRAF(V600E) Kinase Inhibitor RO5185426","RO 5185426","PLX4032","PLX-4032","1-propanesulfonamide, n-(3-((5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1h-pyrrolo(2,3-b)pyridin-3-yl)carbonyl)-2,4-difluorophenyl)-","RG 7204","Zelboraf","BRAF (V600E) kinase inhibitor RO5185426","RG7204","VEMURAFENIB"]},{"ncitCode":"C68923","drugName":"Cobimetinib","uuid":"eb357145-3b18-4aca-b75a-5e18dd2bf4f9","synonyms":["Cotellic","Cobimetinib","XL518","COBIMETINIB","GDC-0973","MEK Inhibitor GDC-0973"]}],"approvedIndications":["Cobimetinib is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, in combination with vemurafenib.

Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807).

The FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551).

In an open-label, randomized, Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade 3 or 4 rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).","additionalInfo":null,"treatments":[{"approvedIndications":["Trametinib is FDA-approved for BRAF V600E or V600K mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma"],"priority":2,"drugs":[{"ncitCode":"C77908","drugName":"Trametinib","uuid":"fb2bb01c-c0ec-4641-abf7-87f486075022","synonyms":["TRAMETINIB","JTP-74057","MEK Inhibitor GSK1120212","N-(3-{3-cyclopropyl-5-[(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)amino]-6,8-dimethyl-2,4,7-trioxo-3,4,6,7-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-1(2H)-yl}phenyl)acetamide","GSK1120212","Trametinib"],"priority":1}]}],"knownEffect":"Sensitive","lastEdit":1526570997000,"lastReview":null,"levelOfEvidence":"LEVEL_1","solidPropagationLevel":"LEVEL_3B","liquidPropagationLevel":"NO","articles":[{"pmid":"29361468","title":"Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib versus standard of care in patients with high-risk, surgically resectable melanoma: a single-centre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial.","journal":"The Lancet.
