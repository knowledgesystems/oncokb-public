# OncoKB Public Website

OncoKB is a precision oncology knowledge base and contains information about the effects and treatment implications of specific cancer gene alterations.
Please cite [Chakravarty et al., JCO PO 2017.](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.17.00011)

This application was generated using JHipster 6.8.0, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.8.0](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.8.0).

## Development

### Running environment

Make sure your running environment is the following:

- **Java version: 8**
- **MySQL version: 5.7.28**
- **Redis**

### Modify config

`/src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml`

1. Confirm database name, username, password under `datasource` config.
2. Change `api-proxy-url` to the URL where oncokb running. For example, `http://localhost:8888/oncokb`
3. Make sure the password for your Redis as same as the password for Redis defined in this file

### Building

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    yarn start

yarn is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Connect with server side locally

After starting project up locally, you should type the following command in your browser console

```
localStorage.setItem("localdev", true)
```

To unset do:

```
localStorage.removeItem("localdev")
```

or

```
localStorage.setItem("localdev", false)
```

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function() {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the oncokb application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean verify

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify

### Packaging with a docker image ready

    ./mvnw package -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild -DskipTests

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw verify

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    yarn test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
