        <p>OncoKB is a precision oncology knowledge base and contains information about the effects and treatment
          implications of specific cancer gene alterations. It is developed and maintained by the Knowledge Systems
          group in the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/programs-centers/molecular-oncology">Marie Jos√©e
            and Henry R. Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology</a> at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
          Center (MSK), in partnership with Quest Diagnostics and Watson for Genomics, IBM.</p>
        <p>Curated by a network of clinical fellows, research fellows, and faculty members at MSK, OncoKB contains
          detailed information about specific alterations in {{numOfGenes}} cancer genes. The information is curated from various
          sources, such as guidelines from the FDA, NCCN, or ASCO, <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>
          and the scientific literature.</p>
          <p>For each alteration, we have curated the biological effect, prevalence and prognostic information, as well as
              treatment implications. Treatment information is classified using the <a href="levels">Levels of
                  Evidence</a> system which assigns the clinical actionability (ranging from standard-of-care to
              investigational or hypothetical treatments) to individual mutational events. OncoKB currently contains
              treatment information for Level 1 and Level 2 (those alterations which are FDA-recognized or considered
              standard care biomarkers predictive of response to FDA-approved drugs in specific disease settings), Level
              3 alterations (those alterations which are considered predictive of response based on promising clinical data to
              targeted agents being tested in clinical trials) and Level 4 (those alterations which are considered
              predictive of response based on compelling biological evidence to targeted agents being tested in clinical
              trials).</p>
