      We are happy to announce the <b>first release of OncoKB</b>, a knowledge base for precision medicine. Our goal is
      to comprehensively annotate the oncogenic effect of mutations observed in cancer, as well as their therapeutic
      implications.
      This release contains information about almost 3,000 variants in 418 cancer genes. For each variant, we
      categorize the biological and clinical effect, along with citations of the source of the information, and, when
      available, the therapeutic implications of a variant. We have focussed on FDA-approved (Level 1) or
      guideline-listed (Level 2) biomarkers, as well as biomarkers that with clinical evidence for sensitivity and for
      which therapies are currently explored in clinical trials (Level 3). See the Levels of Evidence and Actionable
      Genes pages for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have also <b>integrated information from OncoKB into the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics</b>. When exploring
      variants in <a href="http://www.cbioportal.org/" target="_blank">cbioportal.org</a>, you will see annotations from
      OncoKB when available.

    </p>
    <p>
      While we aim to keep the information up to date and correct, there will inevitably be gaps or mistakes. Please
      help us to identify any issues by <b>sending an email to</b> <a
      href="mailto:feedback@oncokb.org?subject=OncoKB Feedback">feedback@oncokb.org</a>, or use the feedback button that
      appears next to variants in cBioPortal.

      <b>Stay tuned</b> for future data updates (improved annotations, new variants), as well as new features. You can
